## ðŸš€ About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Allwin Edilbert
I'm an educator who loves combining traditional teaching with modern tech tools. I specialize in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Python Programming.

ðŸ“š I've earned certifications in Data Science, AWS Machine Learning, and I'm always exploring new ways to bridge the gap between what we teach and what the industry needs.

ðŸš€ I recently mentored a student team for Niral Thiruvila (organized by Naan Mudhalvan), where we placed in the top 1,000 teams out of 8,000 in Tamil Nadu. Our idea also received â‚¹10,000 in funding for further development!

ðŸ’¡ I'm passionate about helping students grow, think creatively, and build impactful projects.
