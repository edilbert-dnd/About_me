ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Allwin Edilbert

ðŸ§ An educator who blends traditional teaching with the power of modern tech. I specialize in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Python Programming, bringing classrooms to life with real-world relevance.

ðŸ“š With certifications in Data Science and AWS Machine Learning, I'm always on the lookout for the latest tools, trends, and technologies to keep my students ahead of the curve.

ðŸš€ In 2024, I mentored a student team for Niral Thiruvila (by Naan Mudhalvan), where we ranked in the top 1,000 out of 8,000+ teams across Tamil Nadu. Our innovative idea even secured â‚¹10,000 in funding for further development!

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about turning curiosity into capabilityâ€”guiding students to think boldly, build meaningfully, and take their ideas beyond the classroom.
